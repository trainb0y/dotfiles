# ######## Not reccomended for use! #########
# This is less of an actual installer, and more of a list of steps I did to get stuff running
# Although it might sort of work, it's more of a refrence material for future me than anything else.
#
# No error handling, doesn't check anything, and does some really stupid things along the way
# Enjoy!
